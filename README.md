# easyPostGIS
This is the development area for the package `easyPostgis`, which provides utility functions to handle data in a postgreSQL database with PostGIS enabled. This package also provides SQL wrappers for common queries often used in ecological analysis (specially for Habitat Suitability and Connectivity).

A stable version of the package is still not available but this development version (possibly unstable) can be installed using `devtools` package. To install it:
library(devtools)
install_github("berdinazzi/easyPostGIS")
