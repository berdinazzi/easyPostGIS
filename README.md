# easyPostGIS
This is the development area for the package `easyPostGIS`, which provides utility functions to handle data in a postgreSQL database with PostGIS enabled. This package also provides SQL wrappers for common queries often used in ecological analysis (specially in Habitat Suitability and Connectivity modelling)

A stable version of the package is still not available but this (possibly unstable) development version  can be installed using `devtools` package. To install it:
library(devtools)
install_github("berdinazzi/easyPostGIS")
